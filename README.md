This repository contains lab exercises for an introductory class in Geographic Information Systems taught at [Temple University](http://temple.edu/)'s Department of [Geography and Urban Studies](http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/).

We have attempted to genericize the labs, so that they can be used apart from any particular lab setting. This means that the exercises do not include due dates, course numbers, instructor names, etc. The exercises are intended to be completed in the following sequence:

1. [Introduction to ArcGIS](Lab_01_Introduction_to_ArcGIS.md) ([pdf](Lab_01_Introduction_to_ArcGIS.pdf)) (1 week)
2. [Projections and Coordinate Reference Systems](Lab_02_Projections_and_CRS.md) ([pdf](Lab_02_Projections_and_CRS.pdf)) (1 week)
3. [Thematic Cartography](Lab_03_Thematic_Mapping.md) ([pdf](Lab_03_Thematic_Mapping.pdf)) (2 weeks)
4. [Tables and Attribute Data](Lab_04_Tables_and_Attribute_Data.md) ([pdf](Lab_04_Tables_and_Attribute_Data.pdf)) (2 weeks)
5. [Digitization/Creating and Editing Map Data](Lab_05_Creating_Geographic_Data.md) ([pdf](Lab_05_Creating_Geographic_Data.pdf)) (2 weeks)
6. [Vector Operations/Overlay Analysis](Lab_06_Vector_Operations.md) ([pdf](Lab_06_Vector_Operations.pdf)) (2 weeks)
7. [Introduction to Raster Analysis](Lab_07_Raster_Analysis.md) ([pdf](Lab_07_Raster_Analysis.pdf)) (2 weeks)

An additional lab exercise is planned to be created for use in future terms:

8. GIS Programming with ArcGIS ModelBuilder (1-2 weeks)

## Data

Many of the lab exercises include instructions for downloading data from public sources. For exercises where data is provided, the data is not currently hosted on GitHub. We are considering an appropriate solution for distributing the data. In the meantime, please contact [Lee Hachadoorian](mailto:Lee.Hachadoorian@temple.edu) to request data files.
